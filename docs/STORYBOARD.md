# ArcFlash – Prevent or Perish

This document outlines the training game concept for ArcFlash. The simulation places the player in charge of electrical safety and maintenance tasks. Each module introduces a scenario related to arc flash hazards and proper preventive practices.

## Game Flow

1. **Game Introduction** – A dark industrial backdrop sets the stage for the simulation. The player can begin the training scenario from here.
2. **Risk Assessment Roulette** – Players inspect an electrical room for potential hazards and classify the risk level.
3. **Energized Work Justification** – Decide when it is acceptable to perform work on energized equipment.
4. **Work Permit Wizard** – Practice assembling an Energized Work Permit with the correct fields and sign-offs.
5. **Boundary Blitz** – Drag and drop the appropriate boundaries around energized equipment.
6. **Infrared Inspection Mission** – Use a thermal camera interface to locate hot spots and identify issues.
7. **Torque Trap** – Choose the correct torque specifications and tools while working on switchgear.
8. **Maintenance Schedule Showdown** – Match equipment with its recommended maintenance interval.
9. **Final Boss: Build the Safety Program** – Compile policy templates, risk categories, maintenance schedules, and training cycles to build a complete electrical safety program.
10. **Game End Screen** – The outcome reflects the player's level of compliance with OSHA and NFPA standards.

This storyboard serves as a high-level guide for implementing a safety-focused training game within this repository.
