# Arcflash Game

This repository contains a simple browser-based game written in HTML5 and JavaScript. "Arcflash" is a quick reaction game: arcs appear at random positions on the screen and the player must click them before they vanish. As the game progresses, arcs spawn faster, increasing the challenge.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Click **Start Game** to begin.
3. Click the glowing arcs that appear on the canvas to gain points.
4. The game speeds up over time. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## Development

No build steps are required; the game runs entirely in the browser. Feel free to modify the HTML and JavaScript to change the visuals or gameplay.
