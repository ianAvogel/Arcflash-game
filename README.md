# ArcFlash &ndash; Prevent or Perish

This repository contains a browser-based training simulation for electrical safety. The game walks the player through a series of short modules covering risk assessment, energized work, permits, boundaries and more. Each correct action raises the compliance score displayed at the end of the session.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Click **Begin Simulation** to start.
3. Complete each module by answering the prompts or interacting with the scene.
4. Your OSHA/NFPA compliance rating is shown after the final module.

The game runs entirely in the browser and requires no build steps.
